 * Generative learning roadmaps.

 * The previous roadmap could only reorder a fixed set of eighteen authored

 * drawn from that list, so every request — whatever it asked for — came back as
 * a permutation of the same eighteen cards. Anything the curriculum did not
 * already cover was simply unreachable.
 *
 * Here the model writes the roadmap itself: any subject, any depth, any time
 * budget. The authored catalogue is still passed in, but only as material the
 * model may reuse — when a generated step genuinely matches an existing module
 * it cites that module's id so the UI can open the real lesson, and otherwise
 * the step stands on its own.

THE LEARNER ASKED FOR:
"${goal}"

Write a roadmap that answers exactly that request. Take seriously whatever they
specified — subject, starting level, time budget, end goal, career intent — and
shape the path around it. If they asked for something outside quantum computing,
still answer for the quantum-adjacent reading of it, or say so in the summary.

AUTHORED MODULES ALREADY IN THE APP (id | title | level | time | summary):
${describeCatalog(catalog)}

HOW TO USE THAT LIST
- It is a library you may draw on, NOT a menu you must pick from.
- When a step you want to teach is genuinely covered by one of those modules,
  set "moduleId" to its id so the learner can open the real lesson.
- When it is not covered, invent the step and leave "moduleId" null. Most
  roadmaps for specific or advanced subjects will be mostly invented steps, and
  that is correct — do not pad a path with loosely related modules just to reuse
  them.

RULES
- Order steps so each one's prerequisites are already covered by earlier steps.
- Between 4 and 9 steps. Prefer fewer, deeper steps over many shallow ones.
- "timeEst" must be a realistic span like "20 mins", "1 hour", "3 hours".
- If the learner gave a total time budget, make the step times roughly add up to it.
- "mathFormula" is a single short expression in plain Unicode (for example
  "|ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩" or "S = -Tr(ρ log ρ)"). Use "" when a step is not mathematical.
- "intuition" is one or two sentences of physical insight, not a restatement of the summary.
- "researchTopic" is 2-5 words naming what to search the literature for on this
  step, or "" if reading papers would not help.
- Never invent citations, paper titles, authors or DOIs. Leave that to search.
